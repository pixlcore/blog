Founded in 2012 by [Joseph Huckaby](https://mastodon.social/@jhuckaby), PixlCore is a versatile and progressive software development company that is independently owned and operated.  Based in [Mendocino, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendocino,_California), the PixlCore team is focused on creating original software for all platforms.

We are the creators of [Cronicle](/view/cronicle) and its upcoming successor [Orchestra](/view/orchestra), multi-server job scheduler web applications.  We also make [Performa](/view/performa), a server monitoring system, plus a variety of other tools and libraries.

Most of our software is open source, and we use the very permissive MIT License, which allows for use in both commercial and personal projects with few restrictions.  Our various works are listed in the sidebar to the left.

This site is designed to showcase our software releases, our commercial products, and the occasional blog post.  We also post updates to the [Fediverse](https://mastodon.social/@pixlcore), if that's your jam.

Thank you for visiting!
