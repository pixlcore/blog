Founded in 2012 by Joseph Huckaby, PixlCore is a versatile and progressive software development company that is independently owned and operated.  Based in Mendocino, CA, the PixlCore team is focused on creating original software for all platforms, but we specialize in web applications.

We also create quality open source software and release it to the community using the very permissive MIT License, which allows for use in both commercial and personal projects.  Our various GitHub projects are listed on the sidebar to the left.

This site is designed to showcase our software releases, our commercial products, and the occasional blog post.

Thank you for visiting!
